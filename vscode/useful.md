# Useful vscode stuff

## Go to file command palette
Exclude directories from command palette:
1. Delete recent files: `File: Clear Recently Opened`
2. Add dirs/files to ignore in `settings.json` (via GUI):
   * `files.exclude`
   * `search.exclude`
3. Make sure `Use exclude settings and ignore files` is toggled in search pane
